# Plan

* Abdominal multi-organ segmentation using deep neural networks (CT)
* Jim Carty
* 2462934C
* Dr. Ali Gooya

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** NA
* **Week 2** Investigate data and prepare it for passing into a neural network
* **Week 3** Research segmentation literature for approaches they use
* **Week 4** Research segmentation literature for possible new/unique takes on current approaches
* **Week 5** Begin creating and continue researching with NN model(s)/approach(es) using TensorFlow or PyTorch
* **Week 6** Train and test NN model, correcting data formats where necessary
* **Week 7** If results are good, then analyse NN results. Otherwise try create another network, such as a sliding window instead of a full scan
* **Week 8** Continue with analysing and/or attempting new NN approaches
* **Week 9** Continue attempting to analyse NN efficacy and attempt to access more data (from UK Blood Bank?) to experiment with transfer learning
* **Week 10** Refine model based on what was learned through experimentation and analysis
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Finish code/NN model and refine data analysis
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 1 (beginning January 9th)** Refine model based on what was learned through experimentation and analysis
* **Week 2** Compute evaluation metrics (Dice Coefficient, Haussdorf Distance, time for inference (ms))
* **Week 3** Refine model further
* **Week 4** Retrain and submit results for validation stage to AMOS 2022 site
* **Week 5** Dockerise model
* **Week 6** Finish dockeristaion and submit for validation stage
* **Week 7** Further refine and resubmit if necessary
* **Week 8** Write Draft Essay
* **Week 9** Write Draft Essay
* **Week 10 [TERM ENDS]** Complete Draft essay
* **Week 11** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
