# Plan

* Abdominal multi-organ segmentation using deep neural networks (CT)
* Jim Carty
* 2462934C
* Dr. Ali Gooya

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** NA
* **Week 2** Investigate data and prepare it for passing into a neural network
* **Week 3** Research segmentation literature for approaches they use
* **Week 4** Research segmentation literature for possible new/unique takes on current approaches
* **Week 5** Begin creating and continue researching with NN model(s)/approach(es) using TensorFlow or PyTorch
* **Week 6** Train and test NN model, correcting data formats where necessary
* **Week 7** If results are good, then analyse NN results. Otherwise try create another network, such as a sliding window instead of a full scan
* **Week 8** Continue with analysing and/or attempting new NN approaches
* **Week 9** Continue attempting to analyse NN efficacy and attempt to access more data (from UK Blood Bank?) to experiment with transfer learning
* **Week 10** Refine model based on what was learned through experimentation and analysis
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Finish code/NN model and refine data analysis
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
