<!-- # Guidance
This is a suggested template for a project. You can modify it as you please, but
but remember to keep:

* a timelog, updated regularly in the `timelog.md` format;
* all source under version control;
* data well organised and with appropriate ethical approval (for human subject data);

Here's an overview of the structure as it stands:

* `data/` data you acquire during the project
* `dissertation/` source and for your project dissertation
* `presentation/` your presentation
* `src/` source code for your project
* `status_report/` the status report submitted in December
* `plan.md` A skeleton week-by-week plan for the project. 
* `timelog.md` The time log for your project.
* `meetings/` Records of the meetings you have during the project.

* Make sure you add a `.gitignore` or similar for your VCS for the tools you are using!
* Add any appropriate continuous integration (e.g. Travis CI) in this directory.

* Remove this `readme.md` file from any repository and replace it with something more appropriate!

## Important
* It should be easy to rebuild and run your project and your dissertation
        * Include clear instructions in the relevant directories to make this possible -->


## All code relevant to the project can be found in the `perceiver-io/` submodule in `src/`
