## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

### 28th Sept 2022

* *0.5 hours* meeting with supervisor
* *1 hour* downloading data and data visualisation tools

## 30th Sept 2022 

* *2 hour* setting up project template, watching introduction session and continuing with data investigation

## 3rd Oct 2022

* *1 hour* experimenting with prebuilt tensorflow segmentation CNNs. discovered I will likely have to make/confgure my own since majority take 3-channel matrices aka RGB images, not arbitrary 3D matrices

## 4th Oct 2022

* *2.5 hours* researching segmentation deep NNs, tensorflow used UNet so I mainly investigated that. found [a UNet implementation that works for 3D single-channel medical images](https://github.com/davidiommi/Pytorch--3D-Medical-Images-Segmentation--SALMON), i.e what my project is meant to be. worked on trying to get it working/training to see its results to evaluate its efficacy

## 5th Oct 2022

* *0.75 hours* weekly meeting and discussion/clarification of goals. identified spatially-aware/4D CNNs as a possible avenue for research this week, along with training and viewing the results of the current CNN approaches to see their shortcomings

## 8th Oct 2022

* *1 hour* formatting data for use with exisiting models and setting up system for training as collab does not have storage capacity. took a while due to data capacity requirements

## 11th Oct 2022

* *2 hours* researching 4D CNNs, medical imaging literature and attempting to train model.

## 12th Oct 2022

* *0.5 hours* researching edge-based segmentation

## 19th Oct 2022

* *2 hours* general research trying to find interesting/relevant papers on vision transformers, attention maps, and spatially-aware cnns

## 20th Oct 2022

* *2 hours* fully reading papers found yesterday and writing up notes and descriptions of them
* *0.5 hours* meeting with Dr. Gooya
